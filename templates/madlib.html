    When {{ person }} went to pick it up, it burst into flames in a totally
    {{ adjective }} way. -->

    A vacation is when you take a trip to some {{ adj1 }} place
with your {{ adj2 }} family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an {{ n1 }} or up on a/an {{ n2 }}.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride {{ pn1 }}
or play {{ game }} or go hunting for {{ pn2 }}. I like
to spend my time {{ vbing1 }} or {{ vbing2 }}.
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three {{ pn3 }} a
day, and fathers play golf, and mothers
sit around {{ vbing3 }}. Last summer, my little brother
fell in a/an {{ n3 }} and got poison {{ plant }} all
over his {{ bodypart }} . My family is going to go to (the)
{{ place }}, and I will practice {{ vbing4 }}. Parents
need vacations more than kids because parents are always very {{ adj3 }} and
because they have to work {{ num }}
hours every day all year making enough {{ pn4 }} to pay
for the vacation.
